Boxpleater. 
An origami design program written with an algorithm by Brandon Wong (The Plant Psychologist), and a lot of help from Undertrox, txst54, and gyosh (you guys can edit it if you want to put your real names).

There are still a lot of things this program can't do, but it still has it's basic functionality as a tool for designers. It can help designers quickly how to construct an inputed tree using box pleating, and gives the user multiple solutions and options to change the grid size. Finally, the designer can export it as a .cp file, and continue the design process in orihime or oripa. 

Also Brandon was a coding noob when he started making this program so there are bugs and unelegant solutions all over the code. Please school him and/or make a pull request if you have any suggestions.
